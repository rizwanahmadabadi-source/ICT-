Registration & Contact Form Project
This project is a simple, responsive web page featuring two functional forms: a Registration Form and a Contact Us Form. It was developed as part of Assignment #2 to demonstrate core concepts of HTML structure and CSS styling.
🚀 Features
Dual Form Layout: Side-by-side positioning using CSS inline-block.
Custom Styling: Unique color schemes for each form to improve user distinction (#e0f2f1 for Registration and #fff3e0 for Contact).
Modern UI Elements:
Rounded corners (border-radius) for a soft look.
Subtle box shadows for a "lifted" 3D effect.
Styled input fields and buttons with hover-ready cursor pointers.
Form Validation Ready: Uses specific input types like email and password.
🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for structuring the forms, inputs, and semantic elements.
CSS3: Used for internal styling, layout management, and color schemes.
